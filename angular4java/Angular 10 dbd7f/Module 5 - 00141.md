# Module 5 - Security and Deployment (part1)

# Chapter 34 - Login and Route Guards (23m)

## 178 Introduction to security (3m)

Before we start this module, we’d like to remove the delays that we added into the Spring REST methods as that was only done for testing purposes.

To make our application secure we’re going to need to do a few different things.

- Requiring users to login (login form so that users will need to enter a username and password)
- Authenticating users (via REST)
- Preventing access to unauthorized users (we might create roles to access different features)
- Secure the REST API (so it can only be accessed by authenticated and authorized users)
- All of this is being code in as safe way as possible using production standard techniques

## 179 An overview of the login functionality (2m)

In this chapter we’re going to require our users to provide a login before they can access the application. The home screen of our application is the Calendar component. We’re going to make it so that anybody on the Internet can view this component, you don’t need to be logged in or register to view it. But if you want to be able to access any other component whether that’s to view or edit rooms and users, or to amend a booking, you will need to be logged in. Right now if the user clicks on the link to view the rooms for example, the application will display the Rooms component.

First of all we’re going to create a *AuthService* service. This is a standard service which will store information about the logged in user. May be their name, whether they’re authenticated or not and what role they have.

We’ll also have a Login component which will display a login form. When the user clicks to view the rooms our code can first of all, check the AuthService to see has our user already been authenticated. If they have, our application can display the Rooms component. If our user is not logged in however, then the application will display the Login component.

## 180 Implementing the AuthService and Login component (4m)

Generate service: `ng g s Auth`

### in auth.service.ts

```tsx
export class AuthService {

  isAuthenticated = false;

  authenticate(name: string, password: string): boolean {
    if (name === 'james' && password === '123') {  // for now
      this.isAuthenticated = true;
    }
    return this.isAuthenticated;
  }
}
```

Generate Login component: `ng g c Login`

### in login.component.ts

```tsx
export class LoginComponent implements OnInit {
  message = '';
  name: string;
  password: string;

  constructor(private authService: AuthService) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
  }

  onSubmit(): void {
    if (this.authService.authenticate(this.name, this.password)) {
      // navigation
    } else {
      this.message = 
					'Your username or password was not recognised - try again';
    }
  }
}
```

### in login.component.html

```html
<h1>Login</h1>

<div class="bg-warning p-5" *ngIf="message">{{message}}</div>

<form #userForm="ngForm">
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="name">Name</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="name" 
					placeholder="user name" [(ngModel)]="name" name="name">
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input type="password" class="form-control" id="password" 
						placeholder="password" [(ngModel)]="password"
           name="password">
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" 
					(click)="onSubmit()">Login</button>
</form>
```

## 181 Implementing a Route Guard (7m)

We’ve built the service and the component. Now we need to think about the redirection pace. The good news is that there is a feature in Angular that will take care of this for us automatically. We’ll use what is called a route guard. A route guard is a way of protecting any of the routes that we define in app module. So if we wanted to display the rooms component, for example, we’ve given that a route to that module, we’re going to say that that is a guarded route. By applying a route guard to a route, it means that there will be a check performed to see if the user is allowed to access this requested route. This access will be determined by looking at the service we need to write called a route guard. So a route guard is a service which implements a specific interface.

The idea is that when the user tries to access the rooms component, Angular will automatically ask the route guard service: “is this allowed?”. The route guard can then check out auth service to allow us to decide if it’s permitted or not. And if it isn’t, it’s the route guard service that will redirect the user to the login component.

We create another service: `ng g s AuthRouteGuard`

You could have many different route guards in our application if you want to be protecting different URLs in different ways. We’re only going to have the one

We’re keeping the route guard and the auth service separate just because we think it will help to understand more easily what’s going on. The route guard is going to be responsible for the navigation part. The auth service is responsible for authentication and storing whether or not our user is authenticated.

### in auth-route-guard.service.ts

```tsx
export class AuthRouteGuardService implements CanActivate{

  constructor(private authService: AuthService) { }

  canActivate(): boolean {
    return this.authService.isAuthenticated;
  }
}
```

### in app.module.ts

```tsx
const routes: Routes = [
  {path : 'admin/users', component : UsersComponent, 
		**canActivate : [AuthRouteGuardService]**},
  {path : 'admin/rooms', component : RoomsComponent, 
		**canActivate : [AuthRouteGuardService]**},
  {path : '', component : CalendarComponent},
  {
    path : 'bookingEdit',
    component : BookingEditComponent,
    resolve : {
      rooms : PrefetchRoomsService,
      users : PrefetchUsersService
    },
    **canActivate : [AuthRouteGuardService]**
  },
  {
    path : 'bookingAdd',
    component : BookingEditComponent,
    resolve : {
      rooms : PrefetchRoomsService,
      users : PrefetchUsersService
    },
    **canActivate : [AuthRouteGuardService]**
  },
  **{path : 'login', component : LoginComponent},**
  {path : '404', component : PageNotFoundComponent},
  {path : '**', redirectTo: '/404'}
];
```

## 182 Redirecting with route guards (6m)

The next step is we actually want, if the RouteGuard doesn’t pass, for our user to be redirected to the Login component. We do that in the RouteGuard itself.

### in auth-route-guard.service.ts

```tsx
export class AuthRouteGuardService implements CanActivate{

  constructor(private authService: AuthService,
              **private router: Router**) { }

  canActivate(**route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, 
							state: RouterStateSnapshot**): boolean {
    if (!this.authService.isAuthenticated) {
      **this.router.navigate(['login'], 
													{queryParams: {requested: state.url}});**
    }
    return this.authService.isAuthenticated;
  }
}
```

### in login.component.ts

```tsx
export class LoginComponent implements OnInit {
  message = '';
  name: string;
  password: string;

  constructor(private authService: AuthService,
              **private router: Router,
              private activatedRoute: ActivatedRoute**) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {}

  onSubmit(): void {
    if (this.authService.authenticate(this.name, this.password)) {
      **const url = this.activatedRoute.snapshot.queryParams['requested'];
      this.router.navigateByUrl(url);**
    } else {
      this.message = 'Your username or password was not recognised - try again';
    }
  }
}
```

# Chapter 35 - Authenticating users via REST (basic auth) (32m)

## 183 The concept of Basic Authentication (4m)

In this chapter we’re going to use the REST backend to validate the users credentials.

The principle of Basic Authentication is that we will provide one or more REST methods in our backend but these will be secured. We’ll only allow the REST method to respond if the users credentials are included within a header which is sent with the REST call. The credentials have to be supplied in a header in a particular format and that format is a header which looks something like this:

`Authorization: Basic some_string_here` - and the string contains the username and password. The string has a specific format which actually is to take the username, then a colon and then a password, and to encode it using something called Base-64 encoding. Base-64 encoding is not in any way secure, it is just a way of combining data, which need not necessarily be text, into a text string. If you’re going to use this on a live application on the Internet, then it’s important that the call to REST is done over SSL. The URL should start with *https* and you should have a valid security certificate on your server. That way this string can’t be intercepted between the client and the server.

## 184 Implementing Basic Authentication in Spring (10m)

Let’s start in the backend and we’ll create a new validateUser method and implement some basic authentication to secure it. We create a new *ValidateUserController*. All the methods in this controller we’re going to secure using Basic authentication. When we write the security configuration we can say “any URL that starts with `api/basicAuth` must be secured by basic authentication”.

### in ValidateUserController.java

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/basicAuth")
public class ValidateUserController {

    @RequestMapping("/validate")
    public String userIsValid() {
        return "{\"result\" : \"ok\"}";
    }
}
```

### in BasicAuthConfig.java

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class BasicAuthConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) 
					throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
                .withUser("james")
                .password("{noop}123")
                .authorities("ROLE_ADMIN");
        // todo: this password should be encoded
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/api/basicAuth/**")
                .hasRole("ADMIN")
                .and()
                .httpBasic();
    }
}
```

## 185 Testing Basic Authentication (2m)

Test using curl: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/basicAuth/validate`

That should returns something like: {"timestamp":"2022-03-27T13:03:58.856+00:00",**"status":401**,"error":"Unauthorized","message":"Unauthorized","path":"/api/basicAuth/validate"}

We’ve base-64 encoded string “james:123” and received “amFtZXM6MTIz” string.

Curl: `curl -H "Authorization: Basic amFtZXM6MTIz" http://localhost:8080/api/basicAuth/validate`

will give `{"result" : "ok"}` response.

## 186 Implementing Basic Authentication in Angular (9m)

We go back to the AuthService. It’s doing authentication locally, but we’ll now want to call the backend in a secure way to do the REST call using basic authentication. We’ll take the name and the password that the user entered as the parameters for the header in our basic authentication. We need an extra method in the data service.

### in data.service.ts

```tsx
validateUser(name: string, password: string) : Observable<string> {
    const headers = new HttpHeaders();
    const authData = btoa(`${name}:${password}`);
    headers.append('Authorization', 'Basic ' + authData);
    return this.http.get<string>(environment.restUrl 
				+ '/api/basicAuth/validate', {headers: headers});
  }
```

### in data.service.local.ts

```tsx
validateUser(name: string, password: string) : Observable<string> {
  return of("ok");
}
```

### in auth.service.ts

```tsx
export class AuthService {

  isAuthenticated = false;
  **authenticationResultEvent = new EventEmitter<boolean>();**

  constructor(**private dataService: DataService**) {
  }

  authenticate(name: string, password: string) {
    **this.dataService.validateUser(name, password).subscribe(
      next => {
        this.isAuthenticated = true;
        this.authenticationResultEvent.emit(true);
      },
      error => {
        this.isAuthenticated = false;
        this.authenticationResultEvent.emit(false);
      }
    )**
  }
}
```

### in login.component.ts

```tsx
export class LoginComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {

  message = '';
  name: string;
  password: string;
  **subscription: Subscription;**

  constructor(private authService: AuthService,
              private router: Router,
              private activatedRoute: ActivatedRoute) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    **this.subscription = this.authService.authenticationResultEvent
																				.subscribe(
      result => {
        if (result) {
          const url = this.activatedRoute.snapshot.queryParams['requested'];
          this.router.navigateByUrl(url);
        } else {
          this.message = 'Your username or password was not recognised - try again';
        }
      }
    )**
  }

  onSubmit(): void {
    **this.authService.authenticate(this.name, this.password);**
  }

  **ngOnDestroy(): void {
    this.subscription.unsubscribe();
  }**
}
```
