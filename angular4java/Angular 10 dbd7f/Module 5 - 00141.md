# Module 5 - Security and Deployment (part1)

# Chapter 34 - Login and Route Guards (23m)

## 178 Introduction to security (3m)

Before we start this module, we’d like to remove the delays that we added into the Spring REST methods as that was only done for testing purposes.

To make our application secure we’re going to need to do a few different things.

- Requiring users to login (login form so that users will need to enter a username and password)
- Authenticating users (via REST)
- Preventing access to unauthorized users (we might create roles to access different features)
- Secure the REST API (so it can only be accessed by authenticated and authorized users)
- All of this is being code in as safe way as possible using production standard techniques

## 179 An overview of the login functionality (2m)

In this chapter we’re going to require our users to provide a login before they can access the application. The home screen of our application is the Calendar component. We’re going to make it so that anybody on the Internet can view this component, you don’t need to be logged in or register to view it. But if you want to be able to access any other component whether that’s to view or edit rooms and users, or to amend a booking, you will need to be logged in. Right now if the user clicks on the link to view the rooms for example, the application will display the Rooms component.

First of all we’re going to create a *AuthService* service. This is a standard service which will store information about the logged in user. May be their name, whether they’re authenticated or not and what role they have.

We’ll also have a Login component which will display a login form. When the user clicks to view the rooms our code can first of all, check the AuthService to see has our user already been authenticated. If they have, our application can display the Rooms component. If our user is not logged in however, then the application will display the Login component.

## 180 Implementing the AuthService and Login component (4m)

Generate service: `ng g s Auth`

### in auth.service.ts

```tsx
export class AuthService {

  isAuthenticated = false;

  authenticate(name: string, password: string): boolean {
    if (name === 'james' && password === '123') {
      this.isAuthenticated = true;
    }
    return this.isAuthenticated;
  }
}
```

Generate Login component: `ng g c Login`
