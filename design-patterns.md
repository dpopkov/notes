Design Patterns
===============

* [The Observer Pattern](#observer")
* [The Factory Method Pattern](#factory-method)
* [The Abstract Factory Pattern](#abstract-factory)


The Observer Pattern<a name="observer"></a>
--------------------

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-meny dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

The Factory Method Pattern<a name="factory-method"></a>
--------------------------

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclass.

The Abstract Factory Pattern<a name="abstract-factory"></a>
----------------------------

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
